\title{Distribute number of swaps}
\usage{
distributeDraws_cpp(data, hierarchy, hid, swaprate, seed = 123456L)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{micro data containing the hierarchy levels and household ID}

\item{hierarchy}{column indices of variables in \code{data} which refere to the geographic hierarchy in the micro data set. For instance county > municipality > district.}

\item{hid}{column index in \code{data} which refers to the household identifier.}

\item{swaprate}{double between 0 and 1 defining the proportion of households which should be swapped, see details for more explanations}

\item{seed}{integer setting the sampling seed}
}
\description{
Distribute number of swaps across lowest hierarchy level according to a predefinde \code{swaprate}. The swaprate is applied such that a single swap counts as swapping 2 households.
Number of swaps are randomly rouded up or down, if needed, such that the total number of swaps is in coherence with the swaprate.
\cr
\strong{NOTE:} This is an internal function used for testing the C++-function \code{distributeDraws} which is used inside the C++-function \code{recordSwap()}.

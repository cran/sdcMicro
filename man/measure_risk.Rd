\description{
The function measures the disclosure risk for weighted or unweighted data.
It computes the individual risk (and household risk if reasonable) and the
global risk. It also computes a risk threshold based on a global risk value.

Prints a 'measure_risk'-object

Prints a 'ldiversity'-object

\details{
To be used when risk of disclosure for individuals within a family is
considered to be statistical independent.

Internally, function \emph{freqCalc()} and \emph{indivRisk} are used for
estimation.

Measuring individual risk: The individual risk approach based on so-called
super-population models. In such models population frequency counts are
modeled given a certain distribution.  The estimation procedure of sample
frequency counts given the population frequency counts is modeled by
assuming a negative binomial distribution. This is used for the estimation
of the individual risk. The extensive theory can be found in Skinner (1998),
the approximation formulas for the individual risk used is described in
Franconi and Polettini (2004).

Measuring hierarchical risk: If \dQuote{hid} - the index of variable holding
information on the hierarchical cluster structures (e.g., individuals that
are clustered in households) - is provided, the hierarchical risk is
additional estimated.  Note that the risk of re-identifying an individual
within a household may also affect the probability of disclosure of other
members in the same household. Thus, the household or cluster-structure of
the data must be taken into account when estimating disclosure risks. It is
commonly assumed that the risk of re-identification of a household is the
risk that at least one member of the household can be disclosed. Thus this
probability can be simply estimated from individual risks as 1 minus the
probability that no member of the household can be identified.

Global risk: The sum of the individual risks in the dataset gives the
expected number of re-identifications that serves as measure of the global
risk.

l-Diversity: If \dQuote{ldiv_index} is unequal to NULL, i.e. if the indices
of sensible variables are specified, various measures for l-diversity are
calculated. l-diverstiy is an extension of the well-known k-anonymity
approach where also the uniqueness in sensible variables for each pattern
spanned by the key variables are evaluated.

numVars=c('expend','income','savings'), w='sampling_weight')

## risk is already estimated and available in...

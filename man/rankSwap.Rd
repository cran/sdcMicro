\title{Rank Swapping}
\usage{
rankSwap(obj, variables = NULL, TopPercent = 5, BottomPercent = 5,
  K0 = -1, R0 = 0.95, P = 0, missing = NA, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{a \code{\link{sdcMicroObj-class}}-object or a \code{data.frame}}

\item{variables}{names or index of variables for that rank swapping is
applied.  For an object of class \code{\link{sdcMicroObj-class}}, all numeric key variables are
selected if variables=NULL.}

\item{TopPercent}{Percentage of largest values that are grouped together
before rank swapping is applied.}

\item{BottomPercent}{Percentage of lowest values that are grouped together
before rank swapping is applied.}

\item{K0}{Subset-mean preservation factor. Preserves the means before and
after rank swapping within a range based on K0.  K0 is the subset-mean
preservation factor such that \eqn{| X_1 -X_2 | \leq \frac{2 K_0
X_1}{\sqrt(N_S)}}{abs(X_1-X_2<=2*K_0*X_1/sqrt (N_S)}, where \eqn{X_1}{X_1}
and \eqn{X_2}{X_2} are the subset means of the field before and after
swapping, and \eqn{N_S}{N_S} is the sample size of the subset.}

\item{R0}{Multivariate preservation factor. Preserves the correlation
between variables within a certain range based on the given constant R0.  We
can specify the preservation factor as \eqn{R_0=\frac{R_1}{R_2}}{R_0 =
R_1/R_2} where \eqn{R_1}{R_1} is the correlation coefficient of the two
fields after swapping, and \eqn{R_2}{R_2} is the correlation coefficient of
the two fields before swapping.}

\item{P}{Rank range as percentage of total sample size. We can specify the
rank range itself directly, noted as \eqn{P}{P}, which is the percentage of
the records. So two records are eligible for swapping if their ranks,
\eqn{i}{i} and \eqn{j}{j} respectively, satisfy \eqn{| i-j | \le \frac{P
N}{100}}{abs(i-j)<P*N/100}, where \eqn{N}{N} is the total sample size.}

\item{missing}{missing - the value to be used as missing value
in the C++ routine instead of NA. If NA, a suitable value is calculated internally.
Note that in the returned dataset, all NA-values (if any) will be replaced with
this value.}

\item{seed}{Seed.}
}
\value{
The rank-swapped data set or a modified \code{\link{sdcMicroObj-class}} object.
}
\description{
Swapping values within a range so that, first, the correlation structure of
original variables are preserved, and second, the values in each record are
disturbed.  To be used on numeric or ordinal variables where the rank can be
determined and the correlation coefficient makes sense.
}
\details{
Rank swapping sorts the values of one numeric variable by their numerical
values (ranking).  The restricted range is determined by the rank of two
swapped values, which cannot differ, by definition, by more than \eqn{P}{P}
percent of the total number of observations.  R0 and K0 are only used if
positive. Only one of the two are used (R0 is prefered if both are
positive).

\examples{
data(testdata2)
data_swap <- rankSwap(testdata2,variables=c("age","income","expend","savings"))

## for objects of class sdcMicro:
data(testdata2)
sdc <- createSdcObj(testdata2,
  keyVars=c('urbrur','roof','walls','water','electcon','relat','sex'),
  numVars=c('expend','income','savings'), w='sampling_weight')
sdc <- rankSwap(sdc)
